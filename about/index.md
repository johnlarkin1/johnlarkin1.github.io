My name is John Larkin. I'm a senior at Swarthmore College, eagerly waiting for my next adventure. I'm an Engineering major, and a Chemistry minor.  

I'm passionate about a lot of different subjects. Currently, my passions are centered around machine learning, algorithms, chemistry, computational biology, and other applications where big data is going to become relevant. 

I have to give a **massive** amount of credit to the following people:
* Matt Zucker (essentially teaching me how to code and helping me tremendously with this blog)
* others...
