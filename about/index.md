My name is John Larkin. I'm a senior at [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/), eagerly awaiting my next adventure. I'm an Engineering major, and a Chemistry minor. 

I play tennis at Swat. Shameless plug for our men's tennis team [here](https://twitter.com/swatmenstennis). I'm from [Cincinnati, Ohio](http://www.skylinechili.com/) (!!) which is conveniently top three of the greatest places in the world. I also love to hike. I've been lucky enough to climb [Mt. Rainier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier) as well as [Mt. Kilimanjaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro). Those are probably the two most noteworthy but I've done a decent amount of 14ers out in Colorado as well.   

I'm passionate about a lot of different subjects. Currently, my passions are centered around machine learning, algorithms, the quantitative side of finance, consulting, chemistry, computational biology, and other applications where big data is going to become relevant. I also really like math and I wish I was better at that.  

I have to give a **massive** amount of credit to the following people:

* Matt Zucker and [his blog](https://mzucker.github.io/)  (essentially teaching me how to code and helping me tremendously with this blog)
* [This guy?](https://zachholman.com/about) Apparently his name is Zach Holman... I really like the way his blog is set up. He also seems like a pretty funny guy.
* This is a really cool blog by [Jamie Wong](http://jamie-wong.com/)! He does a bunch of graphics stuff that will be touched on later.

Again, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments!! I would **love** to have some critiques on the website, as it's still in its infancy. Still trying to figure out if it looks like a child picked the color scheme...

Thanks guys!
