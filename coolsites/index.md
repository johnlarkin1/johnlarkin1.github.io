The internet is a beautiful thing and sometimes I get lost with all the websites I've stumbled across. My bookmarks are overflowing and there are certain sites that I am passionate about and really want to share. I've enumerated a few of them. 

I've **bolded** the ones I really think are :fire:. P.s. I just had ~~an hour~~ ~~1.5 hour~~ two hour long excursion into installing RVM to update Ruby, in order to update my gems so that I had [jemoji][emojis]. I don't really know what nokogiri is but I hate it with a burning passion.
