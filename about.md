Hi :wave: my name is John Larkin. This is my personal coding blog and space for notes and exploring. A little bit about myself, I'm proudly from [Cincinnati, Ohio](http://www.skylinechili.com/). I'm currently writing this the day after a pretty devastating loss to the L.A. Rams. I went to [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/) and graduated class of 2017. I played tennis at Swat and am proud of the team. Shameless plug for our men's tennis team [here](https://twitter.com/swatmenstennis).

I'm now living out in San Francisco with one of my best friends, [Henry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jebhenryhead). I work for [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) doing full-stack development which I am absolutely loving at the moment. If you're interested in working at Dropbox, please feel free to reach out. I've been lucky to work at a couple incredible companies of which I'm still very fond of. Firstly, [Belvedere Trading](https://www.belvederetrading.com/) and more recently, [Ab Initio](https://www.abinitio.com/). Feel free to check out those companies as well. 

I'm passionate about a lot of different subjects. I studied Computer Engineering at Swarthmore with a minor in Chemistry. I had incredible professors who covered a range of different topics from computer vision to Russian literature to the meaning of life (turns out, I'm not great at philosophy). 

Again, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments! I'd love feedback on any articles or on the site itself. Anything to improve. 

Thanks all!
