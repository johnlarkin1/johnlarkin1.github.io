Hi :wave: my name is John Larkin.

This is my personal coding blog and space for notes and exploring.

A little bit about myself, I'm proudly from [Cincinnati, Ohio](http://www.skylinechili.com/). I went to [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/) and graduated class of 2017. I played tennis at Swat and am proud of the team. Shameless plug for our men's tennis team [here](https://twitter.com/swatmenstennis).

Since graduating, I have worked at:

- [Belvedere Trading](https://www.belvederetrading.com/)
- [Ab Initio](https://www.abinitio.com/en/)
- [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/)
- [Mojo Interactive](https://www.mojo.com/)

I've lived in Chicago, Cincinnati, San Francisco, and currently, the Big Apple - New York City. My jobs have varied a little bit, but I absolutely love engineering. I have largely focused on backend engineering, with some full stack exposure at Dropbox on [Dropbox Backup](https://www.dropbox.com/backup) and [Dropbox Replay](https://www.dropbox.com/replay).

Given my field, and the state of Ai, I'd say that I lean more on the Ai doomer side and am trying to prep for that.

<!-- I'm now living out in San Francisco with one of my best friends, [Henry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jebhenryhead). I work for  doing full-stack development which I am absolutely loving at the moment. If you're interested in working at Dropbox, please feel free to reach out. I've been lucky to work at a couple incredible companies of which I'm still very fond of. Firstly,  and more recently, [Ab Initio](https://www.abinitio.com/). Feel free to check out those companies as well. -->

I'm passionate about a lot of different subjects. I studied Computer Engineering at Swarthmore with a minor in Chemistry. I had incredible professors who covered a range of different topics from computer vision to Russian literature to the meaning of life (turns out, I'm not great at philosophy).

Again, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments! I'd love feedback on any articles or on the site itself. Anything to improve.

As of late 2022, I decided to split my blog into a couple of major categories, along with subcategories so you can filter a bit more easily. The categories are **Tech**, **Reflection**, **Publications**, and **Travel**.

Thanks all!
