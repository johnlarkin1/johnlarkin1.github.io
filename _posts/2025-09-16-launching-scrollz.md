I'm happy to announce that as of **September 16th, 2025**, our application [Scrollz App][scrollz-app] is officially in the iOS app store (and the Android store). With that, it's out to 175 countries.

# Context

We built [Scrollz] because we were sick of scrolling through and cluttering our inboxes everyday with various newsletters. We wanted better search, more sophisticated note-taking, sharing, social features, etc. Lots of that we're still working on. It's a cool app, a couple of us put a solid chunk of time and energy into it. I'd appreciate a download and a review. Selfishly, I obviously needed to hit my new years resolution of being accepted onto the app store.

Anyways! Enjoy. Open for thoughts, comments, feedback, etc.
