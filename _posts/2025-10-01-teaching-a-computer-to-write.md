<p>This is a relatively long post! I would encourage you if you're trying to learn from 0 -> 1 to read the whole thing, but feel free to jump around as you so wish. I would say there's three main portions: concept, theory, and code.
</p>

<p>My purpose here was to build up from the basics and really understand the flow. I provide quite a couple of models so we can see the progression from a simple neural net to a basic LSTM to Peephole LSTM to a stacked cascade of Peephole LSTMs to Mixture Density Networks to Attention Mechanism to Attention RNN to the Handwriting Prediction Network to finally throwing it all together to the full Handwriting Synthesis Network that Graves originally wrote about.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

# ‚úçÔ∏è Motivating Visualizations

Today, we're going to learn how to teach a computer to write. I don't mean generating text (which would have been probably a better thing to study in college), I mean learning to write like a human learns how to write with a pen and paper. My results eventually were pretty good, here are some motivating visualizations:

# ü•Ö Motivation

This motivation is clear - this is something that I have wanted to find the time to do right since college. My engineering thesis was on this Graves paper. My senior year, I worked with my good friend (also he's a brilliant engineer) [Tom Wilmots][tom] to understand and dive into this paper.

I'm going to pull pieces of that, but the time has changed, and I wanted to revisit some of the work we did, hopefully clean it up, and finally put a nail in this (so my girlfriend / friends don't have to keep hearing about it).

# üë®‚Äçüè´ History

[Tom] and I were very interested in the concept of teaching a computer how to write in college. There is a very famous [paper] that was published around 2013 from Canadian computer scientist [Alex Graves][ag], titled [_Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks_][gen-sequences]. At [Swarthmore][swat], you have to do Engineering thesis, called [E90s][e90]. It's basically a year (although I'd argue it's more of a semester when it all shakes out) long project focused on doing a piece of work you're proud of.

## Tom and My Engineering Thesis

For the actual paper that we wrote, check it out here:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <embed src="{{ '/pdfs/Handwriting-Synthesis-E90.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="500" height="375" type="application/pdf">
</div>

You can also check it out here: [**Application of Neural Networks with Handwriting Samples**][paper].

# üôè Acknowledgements

Before I dive in, I do want to make some acknowledgements just given this is a partial resumption of work.

- **[Tom Wilmots][tom]** - One of the brightest and best engineers I've worked with. He was an Engineering and Economics double major from [Swarthmore][swat]. Pretty sure I would have failed my E90 thesis without him.
- **[Matt Zucker][mz]** - One of my role models and constant inspirations, Matt was kind enough to be Tom and my academic advisor for this final engineering project. He is the best professor I've come across.
- **[Alex Graves][ag]** - A professor that both Tom and I had the pleasure of working with. **He responded to our emails, which I'm still very appreciative of**. You can see more about his work at the University of Toronto [here][gravesToronto]). He is the author of [this paper][paper], which Matt found for us and pretty much was the basis of our project. He's also the creator of the [Neural Turing Machine][ntm], which peaked my interest after having taken [Theory of Computation][toc], with my other fantastic professor [Lila Fontes][lila] and learning about [Turing machines][turingmachines].
- **[David Ha][dha]** - Another brilliant scientist who we had the privilege of corresponding with. Check out his blog [here][otoro]. It's beautiful. He also is very prolific on [ArXiv][arxiv] which is always cool to see.

# üìù Concept

This section is going to be for non-technical people to understand what we were trying to do. It's relatively simple. At a very high level, **we are trying to teach a computer how to generate human looking handwriting**. To do that, we are going to train a neural network. We are going to use a public dataset, called [IAM Online Handwriting Database][iam-database]. This dataset had a ton of people write on a tablet where the data was being recorded. It collected basically sets of `Stroke` data, which were tuples of $(x, y, t)$, where $(x, y)$ are the coordinates on the tablet, and $t$ is the timestamp. We'll use this data to train a model so that across all of the participants we have this blended approach of how to write like a human.

# üëæ Software

In college, we decided between [Tensorflow][tensorflow] and [Pytorch][pytorch]. In college, we used Tensorflow. However, given the times, I wanted to still resume our tensorflow approach with updated designs, but I also wanted to try and use [JAX]. [JAX] is... newer. But it's gotten some hype online and I think there's a solid amount of adoption across the bigger AI labs now. In my opinion, Tensorflow is dying, Pytorch is the new status quo, and JAX is the new kid on the block. However, I'm not an ML researcher clearing millions of dollars. So grain of salt. This [clickbaity article][pytorch-rant] which declares _"Pytorch is dead. Long live JAX"_ got a ton of flak online, but regardless... it piqued my interest enough to try it here.

I'll cover all three here and yeah probably dive deepest into tensorflow... but feel free to skip this section.

## Tensorflow

### Programming Paradigm

Tensorflow has this interesting programming paradigm, where you are more or less creating a graph. You define `Tensor`s and then when you run your dependency graph, those things are actually translated.

I have this quote from the Tensorflow API:

> There's only two things that go into Tensorflow.
>
> 1. Building your computational dependency graph.
> 2. Running your dependency graph.

This was the old way, but now that's not totally true. Apparently, Tensorflow 2.0 helped out a lot with the computational model and the notion of eagerly executing, rather than building the graph and then having everything run at once.

### Versions - How the times have changed

So - another fun fact - when we were doing this in college, we were on **tensorflow version v0.11**!!! They hadn't even released a major version. Now, I'm doing this on Tensorflow **2.16.1**. So the times have definitely changed.

![being-old](/images/generative-handwriting/being_old.jpeg){: .center-shrink }

Definitely haven't been able to keep up with all those changes.

### Tensorboard

Another cool thing about [Tensorflow][tf] that should be mentioned is the ability to utilize the [Tensorboard][tensorboard]. This is a visualization suite that creates a local website where you can interactively and with a live stream visualize your dependency graph. You can do cool things like confirm that the error is actually decreasing over the epochs.

We used this a bit more in college. I didn't get a real chance to dive into the updates made from this.

## Pytorch

[PyTorch][pytorch] is now basically the defacto standard for most serious research labs and AI shops. To me, it seems like things are still somewhat ported to Tensorflow for production, but I'm not totally sure about convention.

Pytorch seems to thread the line between Tensorflow and JAX. Functions don't necessarily need to be pure to be utilized. You can loop and mutate state in a `nn.Module` just fine.

I won't be covering pytorch but I certainly will come back around to it in later projects.

## JAX

The new up and comer! I think it's largely a crowd favorite for it's speed. Documentation is obviously worse. One Redditor summarized it nicely:

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-theme="dark" data-embed-height="396"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b08qv6/comment/ks6u1e2/">Comment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Few-Pomegranate4369/">u/Few-Pomegranate4369</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b08qv6/d_is_it_worth_switching_to_jax_from/"></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">MachineLearning</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

<br>

I hit numerous roadblocks where functions weren't actually pure and then the JIT compile portion basically failed on startup.

### Programming Paradigm

JAX and Pytorch are definitely the most like traditional Python imperative flow. The restriction on JAX is largely around pure functions. Tensorflow is also gradually moving away from the compile your graph and then run it paradigm.

# üìä Data

We're using the [IAM Online Handwriting Database][iam-database]. Specifically, I'm looking at `data/lineStrokes-all.tar.gz`, which is XML data that looks like this:

![data](/images/generative-handwriting/example_data.png){: .center-super-shrink .lightbox-image}

There's also this note:

> The database is divided into 4 parts, a training set, a first validation set, a second validation set and a final test set. The training set may be used for training the recognition system, while the two validation sets may be used for optimizing some meta-parameters. The final test set must be left unseen until the final test is performed. Note that you are allowed to use also other data for training etc, but report all the changes when you publish your experimental results and let the test set unchanged (It contains 3859 sequences, i.e. XML-files - one for each text line).

So that determines our training set, validation set, second validation set, and a final test set.

# üß† Base Neural Network Theory

I am not going to dive into details as much as we did for our senior E90 thesis, but I do want to cover a couple of the building blocks.

## Lions, Bears, and Many Neural Networks, oh my

I would highly encourage you to check out this website: <https://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/>. I remember seeing it in college when working on this thesis and was stunned. If you're too lazy to click, check out the fun picture:

![neural-network-zoo](/images/generative-handwriting/neural_network_zoo.png){: .center-shrink .lightbox-image}
_Reference for the image.[^1]_{: .basic-center}

We're going to explore some of the zoo in a bit more detail, specifically, focusing on [LSTMs][lstm].

## Basic Neural Network

![basic-nn](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336440220/figure/fig3/AS:839177277042688@1577086862947/A-illustration-of-neural-networks-NNs-a-a-basic-NN-is-composed-of-the-input-output.jpg)
_Reference for the image.[^2]_{: .basic-center}

The core structure of a neural network is the connections between all of the neurons. Each connection carries an activation signal of varying strength. If the incoming signal to a neuron is strong enough, then the signal is permeated through the next stages of the network.

There is a input layer that feeds the data into the hidden layer. The outputs from the hidden layer are then passed to the output layer. Every connection between nodes carries a weight determining the amount of information that gets passed through.

### Hyper Parameters

For a basic neural network, there are generally three [hyperparameters]:

- pattern of connections between all neurons
- weights of connections between neurons
- activation functions of the neurons

In our project however, we focus on a specific class of neural networks called Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and the more specific variation of RNNs called Long Short Term Memory networks ([LSTMs][lstm]).

However, let's give a bit more context. There's really two broad types of neural networks:

- **[Feedforward Neural Network][fnn]**
- **[Recurrent Neural Networks][rnn]**

## Feedforward Neural Network

These neural networks channel information in **one direction**.

The figure above is showing a feedforward neural network because **the connections do not allow for the same input data to be seen multiple times by the same node.**

These networks are generally very well used for mapping raw data to categories. For example, classifying a face from an image.

Every node outputs a numerical value that it then passes to all its successor nodes. In other words:

$$
\begin{align}
y_j = f(x_j)
\end{align}
\tag{1}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align}
x_j = \sum_{i \in P_j} w_{ij} y_i
\end{align}
\tag{2}
$$

where

- $y_j$ is the output of node $j$
- $x_j$ is the total weighted input for node $j$
- $w_{ij}$ is the weight from node $i$ to node $j$
- $y_i$ is the output from node $i$
- $P_j$ represents the set of predecessor nodes to node $j$

Also note, $f(x)$ should be a smooth non-linear activation function that maps outputs to a reasonable domain. Some common activation functions include $\tanh(x)$ or the [sigmoid function][sigmoid]. These complex functions are necessary because the neural network is _literally_ trying to learn a non-linear pattern.

### Backpropagation

[Backpropagation][backprop] is the mechanism in which we pass the error back through the network starting at the output node. Generally, we minimize using [stochastic gradient descent][stoch-grad-desc]. Again, lots of different ways we can define our error, but we can use sum of squared residuals between our $k$ targets and the output of $k$ nodes of the network.

$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k}(t_k - y_k)^2
\end{align}
\tag{3}
$$

The gradient descent part comes in next. We generate the set of all gradients with respect to error and minimize these gradients. We're minimizing this:

$$
\begin{align}
g_{ij} = - \frac{\delta E}{\delta w_{ij}}
\end{align}
\tag{4}
$$

So overall, we're continually altering the weights and minimizing their individual effect oin the overall error of the outputs.

The major downfall of this simple network is that we don't have full context. With sequences, there's not enough information about the previous words, so the context is missing. And that leads us to our next structure.

## Recurrent Neural Network

[Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)][rnn] have a capacity to remember. This memory stems from the fact that their input is not only the current input vector but also a variation of what they output at previous time steps.

This visualization from [Christopher Olah][colah] (who holy hell i just realized is a co-founder of [Anthropic][anthropic], but who Tom and I used to follow closely in college) is a great visualization:

![rnn-unrolled](/images/generative-handwriting/rnn_unrolled.png){: .center-shrink }
_Reference for the image.[^3]_{: .basic-center}

This RNN module is being unrolled over multiple timestamps. Information is passed within a module at time step $t$ to the module at $t+1$.

Per Tom and my paper,

> An ideal RNN would theoretically be able to remember as far back as was necessary in order to to make an accurate prediction. However, as with many things, the theory does not carry over to reality. RNNs have trouble learning long term dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem. An example of such a long term dependency might be if we are trying to predict the last word in the following sentence ‚ÄùMy family originally comes from Belgium so my native language is PREDICTION‚Äù. A normal RNN would possibly be able to recognize that the prediction should be a language but it would need the earlier context of Belgium to be able to accurately predict DUTCH.

Topically, this is why the craze around LLMs is so impressive. There's a lot more going on with LLMs... which... I will not cover here.

The notion of [backpropagation][backprop] is basically the same just we also have the added dimension of time.

The crux of the issue is that RNNs have many layers and as we begin to push the derivatives to zero. The gradients become too small and cause underflow. In actual meaning, the networks then cease to be able to learn.

However, [Sepp Hochreiter][sepp-hochreiter] and [Juergen Schmidhuber][juergen-schmidhuber] developed the [Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)][lstm] unit that solved this vanishing gradient problem.

## Long Short Term Memory Networks

[Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)][lstm] networks are specifically designed to learn long term dependencies.

Every form of RNN has repeating modules that pass information across timesteps, and LSTMs are no different. Where they different is the inner structure of each module. While a standard RNN might have a single neural layer, LSTMs have four.

![lstm-viz](/images/generative-handwriting/lstm.png){: .center-shrink }
_Reference for the image.[^3]_{: .basic-center}

### Understanding the LLM Structure

So let's better understand the structure above. There's a way more comprehensive walkthrough [here][colah]. I'd encourage you to check out that walkthrough.

![lstm-viz](/images/generative-handwriting/single_lstm_module.png){: .center-super-shrink }
_Reference for the image.[^3]_{: .basic-center}

The top line is key to the LSTM's ability to remember. It is called the cell state. We'll reference it as $C_t$.

The first neural network layer is a sigmoid function. It takes as input the concatenation between the current input $x_t$ and the output of the previous module $h_{t-1}$. This is coined as the forget gate. It is in control of what to forget for the cell state. The sigmoid function is a good architecture decision here because it basically outputs numbers between [0,1] indicating how much the layer should let through.

We piecewise multiply the output of the sigmoid layer $f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$, with the cell state from the previous module $C_{t-1}$, forgetting the things that it doesn't see as important.

Then right in the center of the image above there are two neural network layers which make up the update gate. First, $x_t \cdot h_{t-1}$ is pushed through both a sigmoid ($\sigma$) layer and a $\tanh$ layer. The output of this sigmoid layer $i_t = \sigma (W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)$ determines which values to use to update, and the output of the $\tanh$ layer $\hat{C} = \sigma (W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_{t} + b_C$, proposes an entirely new cell state. These two results are then piecewise multiplied and added to the current cell state (which we just edited using the forget layer) outputting the new cell state $C_t$.

The final neural network layer is called the output gate. It determines the relevant portion of the cell state to output as $h_t$. Once again, we feed $x_t \cdot h_{t-1}$ through a sigmoid layer whose output, $o_t = \sigma (W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)$, we piecewise multiple with $\tanh(C_t)$. The result of the multiplication determines the output of the LSTM module. Note that the <span style="color:purple">**purple**</span> $\tanh$ is not a neural network layer, but a piecewise multiplication intended to push the current cell state into a reasonable domain.

# üß¨ Concepts to Code

When very first starting this project, I kind of figured that I would be able to use some of my college code, but looking back. It's quite a mess and I don't think that's the way to go about it.

I thought for awhile about how best to structure this part. Meaning the code, but also how to show this in my blog post. With all the buzz about JAX, I wanted to try that too, so I thought it'd be helpful to show a side be side translation of the tensorflow vs jax code. My hope is that we'll walk through the concepts and have a good understanding of the theory, and then the code will make a bit more sense. One note, is that I was a bit burnt of this project by the end so the JAX code I was trying to use [`optax` (link)][optax] and [`flax` (link)][flax] as much as possible to cut down on bulkiness of code.

So we'll walk through the building blocks (in terms of code) and then show the code translations.

## LSTM Cell with Peephole Connections

### Theory

The basic LSTM cell (`tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell`) does not actually have the notion of peephole connections.

According to the very functional code that [sjvasquez] wrote, I don't think we actually need it, but I figured it would be fun to implement regardless. Back in the old days, when Tensorflow would support add-ons, there was some work around this [here][lstm-peep], but that project was deprecated.

That being said.... the JAX / Flax code also doesn't have LSTMs out of the gate with peepholes and so.... I just used the normal ones. The JAX model actually trained a bit better, but I think part of that was also just patience.

## Gaussian Mixture Models

### Theory

![gmm-viz](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:996/1*kJYirC6ewCqX1M6UiXmLHQ.gif){: .basic-center }
_Reference for the image... I didn't create this one[^4]_{: .basic-center}

[Gaussian Mixture Models][gmm] are an unsupervised technique to learn an underlying probabilistic model.

Brilliant has an incredible explanation walking through the theory [here][gmm]. I'd encourage you to check it out, but at a very high level:

1. A number of Gaussians is specified by the user
2. The algo learns various parameters that represent the data while maximizing the likelihood of seeing such data

So if we have $k$ components, for a _multivariate_ Gaussian mixture model, we'll learn $k$ means, $k$ variances, $k$ mixture weights, $k$ correlations through expectation maximization.

From [Brilliant][brilliant], there are really two steps for the EM step:

> The first step, known as the expectation step or E step, consists of calculating the expectation of the component assignments $C_k$ for each data point $x_i \in X$ given the model parameters $\phi_k, \mu_k$ , and $\sigma_k$ .
>
> The second step is known as the maximization step or M step, which consists of maximizing the expectations calculated in the E step with respect to the model parameters. This step consists of updating the values $\phi_k, \mu_k$ , and $\sigma_k$ .

### Code

There's actually not a whole lot of code to provide here. GMMs are more of the technique that we'll combine with the output of a neural network. That leads us smoothly to our next section.

## Mixture Density Networks

### Theory

[Mixture Density Networks][mdn] are an extension of GMMs that predict the parameters of a mixture probability distribution.

![mdn-viz](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1UKuoYsGWis22cOV7KpLjVg.png){: .basic-center }
_Reference for the image.[^6]_{: .basic-center}

Per our paper:

> The idea is relatively simple - we take the output from a neural network and parametrize the learned parameters of the GMM. The result is that we can infer probabilistic prediction from our learned parameters. If our neural network is reason- ably predicting where the next point might be, the GMM will then learn probabilistic parameters that model the distribution of the next point. This is different in a few key aspects. Namely, we now have target values because our data is sequential. Therefore, when we feed in our targets, we minimize the log likelihood based on those expectations, thus altering the GMM portion of the model to learn the predicted values.

More or less though, the problem we're trying to solve is predicting the next input given our output vector. Essentially, we're asking for $\text{Pr}(x_{t+1} \| y_t)$. I'm not going to show the proof (we didn't in our paper right), but the equation for the conditional probability is shown below:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Pr}(x_{t+1} | y_t) = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \pi_{j}^t \mathcal{N} (x_{t+1} \mid \mu_j^t, \sigma_j^t, \rho_j^t)
\end{align}
\tag{5}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma, \rho) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sqrt[]{1-\rho^2}} \exp \left[\frac{-Z}{2(1-\rho^2)}\right]
\end{align}
\tag{6}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align}
Z = \frac{(x_1 - \mu_1)^2 }{\sigma_1^2} + \frac{(x_2 - \mu_2)^2}{\sigma_2^2} - \frac{2\rho (x_1 - \mu_1) (x_2 - \mu_2) }{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}
\end{align}
\tag{7}
$$

Now, there's a slight variation here because we have a handwriting specific _end-of-stroke_ parameter. So we modify our conditional probability formula to result in our final calculation of:

$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{Pr}(x_{t+1} \mid y_t ) = \sum\limits_{j=1}\limits^{M} \pi_j^t \; \mathcal{N} (x_{t+1} \mid \mu_j^t, \sigma_j^t, \rho_j^t)
\begin{cases}
e_t & \textrm{if } (x_{t+1})_3 = 1 \\
1-e_t & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
\tag{8}
$$

And that's it! That's our final probability output from the MDN. Once we have this, performing our expectation maximization is simple as our loss function that we choose to minimize is just:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}) = - \sum\limits_{t=1}^{T} \log \textrm{Pr}(x_{t+1} \mid y_t)
\end{align}
\tag{9}
$$

## Mixture Density Loss

### Theory

I already covered the theory above, so I won't go into that here, but just figured it was easier to split out the code between network and calculating our loss. Note, there's some pretty aggressive clipping going on just given I had some pretty high instability with JAX. I think partially because of the implementation and clipping but loss would just go to 0 rather than the program crashing. To be clear, loss going to zero was not desired.

## Attention Mechanism

### Theory

The attention mechanism really only comes into play with the Synthesis Network which sadly [Tom][tom] and I never got to in college. The idea (similar to most attention notions) is that we need to tell our model more specifically where to focus. This isn't like the transformer notion of attention from the famous "Attention is All You Need" paper, but it's the idea that we have various Gaussians to indicate probabilistically where we should be focusing. We utilize one-hot encoding vectors over our input characters so that we can more clearly identify the numerical representation. So the question we're basically answering is like "oh, i see a 'w' character, generally how far along do we need to write for that?" to help also answer the question of when do we need to terminate.

The mathematical representation is here:

> Given a length $U$ character sequence $\mathbf{c}$ and a length $T$ data sequence $\mathbf{x}$, the soft window $w_t$ into $\mathbf{c}$ at timestep $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq T$) is defined by the following discrete convolution with a mixture of $K$ Gaussian functions
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> \phi(t, u) &= \sum_{k=1}^K \alpha^k_t\exp\left(-\beta_t^k\left(\kappa_t^k-u\right)^2\right)\\
> w_t &= \sum_{u=1}^U \phi(t, u)c_u
> \end{align}
> $$
>
> where $\phi(t, u)$ is the \emph{window weight} of $c_u$ at timestep $t$.
>
> Intuitively, the $\kappa_t$ parameters control the location of the window, the $\beta_t$ parameters control the width of the window and the $\alpha_t$ parameters control the importance of the window within the mixture.
>

## Stacked LSTM

### Theory

The one distinction between Graves's setup and a standard LSTM is that Graves uses a _cascade_ of LSTMs. So we use the MDN to generate a probabilistic prediction however our neural network is the cascade of LSTMs.

Per our paper:

> The LSTM cascade buys us a few different things. As Graves aptly points out, it mitigates the vanishing gradient problem even more greatly than a single LSTM could. This is because of the skip-connections. All hidden layers have access to the input and all hidden layers are also directly connected to the output node. As a result, there are less processing steps from the bottom of the network to the top.

So it looks something like this:

![graves-stacked-lstm](/images/generative-handwriting/graves_stacked_lstm.png){: .center-shrink }
_Alex Graves 2013.[^5]_{: .basic-center}

The one thing to note is that there is a dimensionality increase given we now have these hidden layers. Tom and I broke this down in our paper here:

> Let's observe the $x_{t-1}$ input. $h_{t-1}^1$ only has $x_{t-1}$ as its input which is in $\mathbb{R}^3$ because $(x, y, eos)$. However, we also pass our input $x_{t-1}$ into $h_{t-1}^2$. We assume that we simply concatenate the original input and the output of the first hidden layer. Because LSTMs do not scale dimensionality, we know the output is going to be in $\mathbb{R}^3$ as well. Therefore, after this concatenation, the input into the second hidden layer will be in $\mathbb{R}^6$. We can follow this process through and see that, the input to the third hidden layer will be in $\mathbb{R}^9$. Finally, we concatenate all of the LSTM cells (i.e. the hidden layers) together, thus getting a final dimension of $\mathbb{R}^{18}$ fed into our MDN. Note, this is for $m=3$ hidden layers, but more generally, we can observe the relation as
>
> $$\begin{align} \textrm{final dimension} = k \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \end{align}$$

### Code

This is where the various `cell` vs `layer` concept in Tensorflow was very nice.

You can see here how the parts all come together smoothly. The custom RNN cell takes the lstm_cells (which are stacked), and then can basically abstract out and operate on the individual time steps without having to worry about actually introducing another `for` loop. This is beneficial because of the batching and GPU win we can get when it eventually becomes time.

For the actual `AttentionRNNCell`, this is what I'm talking about:

And the various concatenation between inputs is what Graves means when he says "deep in space and time".

## Final Result

Alright finally! So what do we have, and what can we do now?

We now are going to feed the output from our LSTM cascade into the GMM in order to build a probabilistic prediction model for the next stroke. The GMM will then be fed the actual next point, in order to create some idea of the deviation os that the loss can be properly minimized.

Ok so that's all well and good and some fun math and neural network construction, but the meat of this project is about what we're actually building with this theory. So let's lay out our to-do list.

### Problem #1 - Gradient Explosion Problem

Somehow on my first run through of this, I was still getting explodient gradients in the later stages of training my model.

As a result, I chose the laborious and time consuming process to run the training model on CPU so that I could print out debugging information and then run `tensorboard`'s Debugger model so I could inspect which gradients were exploding to `nan` or dreaded `inf`.

Here's an example of what that looked like:

![tensorboard](/images/generative-handwriting/tensorboard-debugging.png){: .center-image}

Which was even more annoying because of this: <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/59215> issue.

### Problem #2 - OOM Galore

Uh oh, looks like the `vast.ai` instance I utilized didn't have enough memory. Here is an example of one of the errors I ran into:

  <summary style="background-color: #f8d7da; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer; color: #721c24; font-weight: bold;">

### Sanity Check - Validating Model Dimensions (with AI... so somewhat)

So where does AI using AI come in? I wanted to validate that the shapes of my training parameters all looked good. Again, I print out the shapes on the very first epoch to get some more details and do a quick dimensionality alignment check. I then fed that into ChatGPT along with the paper and asked it to double check all my params. Here was it's output:

## Drawing Code

This was largely autoregressively sampling from the model given various text input (at least for the synthesis model). I honestly just had Claude Code do most of the heavy lifty explaining the project and what I wanted to see `phi`s, kappa progression, mixture density gaussians lighting up, etc.

## Visualizations

### Learning with Dummy Data

Again, we used dummy data to start with to ensure our various components were learning and converging correctly.

Here is the dummy data:

![dummy_data](/images/generative-handwriting/viz/dummy_data.png){: .center-shrink}

Here is just our cascade of LSTMs learning on the loop-da-loop data and predicting on a single sequence. This is not optimized or utilizing the mixture density network.

![handwriting_loop_lstm_simple](/images/generative-handwriting/viz/handwriting_loop_simplified.gif){: .center-shrink }

![handwriting_zig_lstm_simple](/images/generative-handwriting/viz/handwriting_zigzag_simplified.gif){: .center-shrink }

Here is our entire network and just sampling from the means (not showing the mixture densities) across the entire example datasets. One thing to note here if you can see how the LSTMs can still handle this type of larger contexts. Again, it pales in comparison to modern day transformer context, but still impressive.

![handwriting_zig_lstm_simple](/images/generative-handwriting/viz/zigzag_epoch200_mixtures5.gif){: .center-shrink }

# Conclusion

This - again - was an absolute bear of a project and took considerable effort and engineering.

I don't think I'll embark on a project of this nature in awhile, unless I can feel some more tangible external benefits of doing something like this. But enjoy! And feel free to pull the code and dive in yourself.

When re-reading my old draft blog post, I liked the way I ended things. So here it is:
