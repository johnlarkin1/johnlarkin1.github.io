In order to increase [Porvata's][porvata] delivery and customer support, they decided to integrate with [Ryder][ryder]

# Design

So Ryder can support borderline endless file format communications. They prefer [AC2][ac2], or Applicability Statement 2, which is:

> a http based protocol to transmit messages (especially EDI messages) safely, cheaply and quickly.
