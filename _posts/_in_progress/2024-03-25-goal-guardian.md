Technical Commentary
====================

#### iOS + SwiftUI

I think my favorite part of SwiftUI is just the sheer simplicity. MVVM or MVC? Seems like you kinda can basically even simplify it further so that you're just being way more imperative, way less code pasta. 

There's a good article about it here:
*  [Apple Forum on SwiftUI Data Model][swiftui-data-model]

#### Extensions

I really want this to become a watchOS app so that I can mark some of these goals as complete on my watch rather than my iPhone, but not that fast of a developer (and also I shattered my Apple Watch playing soccer in NYC.)
