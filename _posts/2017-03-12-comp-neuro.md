title: Computational Neuroscience - Coursera Class

I was curious to learn more about computational neuroscience. This [class] was a good start.

I was interested to learn more about computational neuroscience, partially because I was curious about how the brain works, partially because I liked the computational aspect, and partially because my brilliant sister [Sydney Larkin][syd] was a neuroscience major at [Middlebury College][midd].

This is going to be a little different type of blog post, because I really just wanted to promote the class. It was an interesting cross section between biology, neuroscience, and computer science. It highlighted some interesting statistical and mathematical tools that I had not seen before, like [expectation-maximization][em] and a more in depth view of [PCA] than I had seen. I also learned a decent bit about some human anatomy - like the [peripheral nervous system (PNS)][PNS] to the [cerebrum].

If you want to breeze through some notes, but not take the class (although I encourage you to take the [class] if you can find the time!!), then you can find my notes [here][notes]. I've also included all of the code that I used to answer the quiz. PLEASE do not abuse this. Make sure to fully attempt all the quizzes and only look at my code if you're desperate. Also feel free to email me questions - although, I'm far from an expert. 

**Once again, you can get the notes [here][notes].** 

In addition, there was one aspect I could not get... I posted on Stack Overflow about it after I kept getting it wrong and couldn't code up a solution. If you think you can help, I'd love for you to answer my question on Stack! Check it out [here][question].
