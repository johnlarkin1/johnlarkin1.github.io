summary: A NoSQL monster. This is what I looked like taking the classes.

I wanted to learn a bit more about ScyllaDB given I've been hearing some great things about it.

# Motivation

I got some fun swag!!

# Context

My company is also an early adapter of [ScyllaDB][scylla] and as a result, I've gotten to explore and play around with it some.

We're also big consumers of Go and given that Go is a statically typed language, I wanted to build out some more support for the interaction between Scylla and Go. I'll hopefully be writing about that in the future when I get things in a more publishable state.

# Initial Introduction

I had previously worked some with NoSQL databases like Cassandra (of which Scylla is basically a descendant), but not to the degree that I have been doing recently.

As a result, I thought it would be best to go through the formal 0 -> 1 training from their tutorials and educational videos. So I jumped over to [Scylla University][scyllau] and took their

# S101 Class Notes

These aren't the best notes, but I'd encourage pulling a docker image that has this set up and experimenting with the consistency level. Probably the best part of the class.

## Introduction

### Intro and Overview

Disney and other big companies are using it.

- 10x higher throughput compared to other dbs
- Up 10 1M r/w operations per node per second
- Compatible with Apache Cassandra and DynamoDB

### NoSQL and ScyllaDB Overview

- CAP Theorem
  - Distributed databases have 3 characteristics
    - **Consistency**
      - For the latest read request, we always get the latest write
    - **Availability**
      - Always able to serve requests despite hardware failures and whatever
    - **Partition Tolerance**
      - If there's a network failure, or node failures, we're still serving requests
  - ScyllaDB prefer Availability and Partition Tolerance
- NoSQL - By Data Model
  - Key/Value -> RocksDB, EroSpike, redis
  - Document store MongoDB, Couchbase
  - Wide column store -> ScyllaDB, cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, Apache HBase
  - Graph -> JanusGraph, neo4j
- ScyllaDB Attributes
  - High availability
  - High scalability
  - High performance
  - Low maintenance
  - Drop in replacement, Cassandra DynamoDB

### Design Decisions and ScyllaDB Flavors

- Shard per Core model
  - ThreadPool model (Apacha Cassandra)
    - Thread is chosen whenever we have a job
    - Lots of context switching
    - Puppies eating from the same bowls, some bowls are left empty, etc
- Ecosystem Compatibility
  - Apache Cassandra is very popular
    - CQL native protocol
    - JMX mangaement
    - Management command line
    - SSTable file format
- Cost Effective
  - vs DynamoDB
    - 1/5th cost
    - 20x better latencies
  - vs Cassandra
    - 4 Scylla nodes vs 40 Cassandra nodes
    - 2.x less expensive
    - 11x better latencies
  - vs BigTable
    - 1/7th cost
    - 26x performance

### Basic Concepts and Intro to Architecture

- Basic Architecture - node
  - consists of shards
  - contains portion of DB content
  - all nodes are equal
- Cluster - node ring
  - 5 nodes for example working otgether
- Partition key
  - get a partition key, we hash, we then find which cluster to go to
  - and so we know which nodes are responsible
- **Token Ranges**
  - Each node is responsible for a range of tokens
  - Scylla knows which node is responsible for the data
  - As a user, that performs the query, we don't have to
- **Data Replication**
  - Replciation Factor: number of nodes where data (rows and partitions) are replicated
  - Done automatically
  - Set for keyspace
- **Consistency Level:**
  - CL: # of nodes that must acknowledge read/write
  - i.e. 1, QUORUM, LOCAL_QUORUM
  - Tunable consistency: CL set per operation

### The Read/Write Path

- Client makes a write request
- Coordinator node receives the data
- Example:
  - RF = 3
    - That means that each piece of data is replicated to three separate nodes
  - Consistency level = QUORUM
    - Requires that 2 / 3 nodes acknowledges that
  - Client sends request
  - Node V gets it
  - Node V executes the consistent hash
  - It knows which of the three nodes are responsible for the data
  - So there's this `write` -> `ack` communication
  -

## Quick Wins: Install and Run ScyllaDB

Done. Basically this:

╭─johnlarkin@Johns-MacBook-Pro ~
╰─➤ remindme-scylla-docker
Commands to run and mess around with cqlsh:
===========================================
docker run --name scyllaU -d scylladb/scylla:5.2.0 --overprovisioned 1 --smp 1
docker exec -it scyllaU nodetool status
docker exec -it scyllaU cqlsh

# Then once you're in the interactive shell:

CREATE KEYSPACE mykeyspace WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1};
use mykeyspace;
CREATE TABLE users ( user_id int, fname text, lname text, PRIMARY KEY((user_id)));
insert into users(user_id, fname, lname) values (1, 'rick', 'sanchez');
insert into users(user_id, fname, lname) values (4, 'rust', 'cohle');

## High Availability

### Replication Factor

Relatively straightforward. Sets how many copies of the data is made.

### Consistency Level

- Determines how many repliaces in a cluster must acknowledge a read or write operqation before its considered successful

Some common levels:

- `ANY`
  - A write must be written to at least one replica in the cluster
  - A read waits for a response from at least one replica
  - This provides the highest availability with the lowest consistency
- `QUORUM`
  - When a majority of the replicas respond, the request is honored
  - If `RF=3` then 2 replicas respond. `QUORUM` can be calculated using the formula (`n/2 + 1`) where `n` is the Replication Factor.
- `ONE`
  - If one replica responds, the request is honored
- `LOCAL_ONE`
  - At least one replica in the local data center responds
- `LOCAL_QUORUM`
  - A quorum of replicas in the local datacenter responds
- `EACH_QUORUM`
  - Unsupported for reads - a quorum of replicas in _all_ datacenters must be written to
- `ALL`
  - A write must be written to _all_ replicas in the cluster, a read waits for a response from all replicas. Provides teh lowest availability with the highest consistency

**Note:** A write it always sent to _all_ replicas, as set by the Replication Factor.

## Architecture

Just reviewed a lot of the material above.

# Conclusion

The whole point of this post is this portion. ScyllaDB is great and I've been loving using it, but the best part is for sure that I chatted some with the instructor, [Guy Shtub](https://www.scylladb.com/author/guy/), begged him for a shirt (because I don't have enough tech shirts), he said no, i begged harder, and then voila, get a good look:
