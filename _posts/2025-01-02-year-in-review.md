# Introduction

Yet again, another year has raced by. These posts started out as a tradition to outline my previous goals, check in and see how I did, and think about what I wanted to accomplish in the upcoming year.

It's hard to find the time for self reflection. And I honestly think that I haven't really done this "series" as much justice as it probably deserves. I'm not sure this post will either, but I'll give it an honest shot.

Anyway, not that last year's was much, but check it out here:

# Reflection on 2024

## Qualitative Thoughts

2024 was a great year. Some definite hardships, some definite highlights, but generally I am very pleased with how things are sitting.

This year felt filled with travel and adventures.

On New Year's Day exactly one year ago (and a day), I woke up in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. We were lucky enough to just spend Christmas there again this past year. It was a pretty poetic moment.

I generally get very caught up on the past. Perhaps it's part of the obsessive fixating nature of my family, perhaps that's what helps me be a good engineer, perhaps it's just who I am. Regardless, I'll be cognizant about going through each week of the year looking at my camera roll. It would only be a lot of a time suck, and I don't think it'd be that beneficial.

But maybe I'll summarize:

- Woke up in Cabo
- Went to celebrate Bryan and Riley's engagement in Charleston
- Hung with Will in NYC
- Celebrated Luke and Tori's engagement in Chicago
- Hung out with my NYC friends
- Hung out with my now former (🥺) roommates
- Went skiing at Beaver Creek
- Went skiing at Jackson Hole
- Quit my job at [Dropbox][dropbox]
- Went to Florida, went to Rochester MN
- Joined [Mojo][mojo]
- Started seeing my new girlfriend
- Worked out at CPF with Nick and Tommy
- Did the Saint George 70.3
- Went with my Dad, sister, brother-in-law to Zambia and Namibia (could probably write a full blog on this)
  - Saw elephants, went ATV-ings, surfed on sand, hot air balloons, played cards, etc
- Came back to NYC, soaked up summertime
- Played lots of tennis
- Helped my sister and BIL move to Chicago
- Went to Michigan
- Went to Cincy
- Went to Sugarcreek, Wisconsin
- Moved into my own apartment
- Went to an art class
- Went to Cincy and watched tennis
- Went to Switzerland with my Mom
  - Could also do a full blog on this. Saw Zermatt, hiked beautiful views, etc.
- Saw Nancy in the city
- Celebrated Ari's bachelor party
- Hung out with Berliant
- Ran a marathon with Billy and Clare
- Went to a Brooklyn warehouse rave for Halloween
- Dogsat for Jack
- Halloween as Ben Affleck as well
- Celebrated my Dad's 70th
- Celebrated Ari and Aly's wedding
- Worked out with Steele
- Enjoyed Chicago for Thanksgiving
- Explored Costa Rica pre Christmas
- Explored Cabo again for Christmas
- Celebrated NYE/New Years in New York

It was an incredible year. I'm lucky that I had it.

## Quantitative Goals

I'm not going to really talk about my 2024 resolutions and how I did. Largely because I took the Google sheets approach and that's not really sticking quite as much as I wanted. I'm still determined to build something that helps it stick more for me.

That being said, I did end up doing pretty well with both reading, physical goals, and blog posts (for the first couple months of the year... I posted 8 times in 2024 which I think is a record in past years).

For next year, I'm trying Notion for my resolutions and goals. I've scoped out my resolutions for next year. I'm not sharing them because some of them are a bit personal, but looking forward to the challenge.

# Going Forward

We're already in 2025. A perfect square year, and probably the last one I'll ever see (unless I stop aging).

I have the feeling that it's going to be a good year.
