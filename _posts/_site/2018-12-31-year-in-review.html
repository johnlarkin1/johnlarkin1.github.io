<p>A less technical post and some light analysis on my 2018 New Year resolutions.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>I think December of 2017 I came up with a spreadsheet for New Years Resolutions. I’m not going to put all of my resolutions on display because some are decently personal, but I’ve linked the template <a href="https://github.com/johnlarkin1/new-years-resolution-template">here</a>. Below, you can see a screenshot of some of my resolutions for 2018.</p>

<p>The template provides some various nice features - like color coding and then automatically generating some basic visualizations.</p>

<p>I’m not really going to talk about that however. This post is going to be (unsurprisingly for me) self centered and talking more about my past year.</p>

<h1 id="analysis-of-2018">Analysis of 2018</h1>

<p>This isn’t going to be long. But I thought it was important. I decided I was going to push up a blog post on my year as a way of ensuring accountability - even if it’s just for my own sake, publically listing some of my resolutions and how I did overall will help me internally have a sense of accountability.</p>

<p>I broke my resolutions into a couple of different categories - Physical, Reading, Italian, Extracurricular, Stretch goal, Relationships.</p>

<p>A basic summary of how I did is here.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Category</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Made</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">In Progress</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Missed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Physical</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Reading</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">3</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Italian</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">8</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Extracurricular</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">55</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">3</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Work</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">0</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Stretch goal</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">0</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Relationships</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">0</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">0</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Which really ends up generating the following graph in terms of percentages:</p>

<p>Which to be honest is pretty embarassing. Lot of red there… I <strong>need</strong> to start reading way more. I think I’ve done a better job towards the end of 2018 but yeah that’s pretty abysmal. Relationships I also tanked. Granted there were only two goals I set in that department and one was kind of a stretch, but pretty disappointed with that. Work I did ok with but it was hard to keep the motivation up. Physical I did well. I was happy with where I ended up. One of them that I missed was run another marathon, but I did a triathlon instead and in my opinion that was a much better decision.</p>

<p>In addition, I didn’t push enough to this blog. I like blogging and I like doing fun coding challenges and projects in my spare time or taking classes. And I really didn’t even give myself enough of a chance to do that. Partially because I was pretty low on time and still trying to adjust.</p>

<h1 id="take-away">Take Away</h1>
<p>I think that 2018 was a strong year for me. I struggled with adjusting fully to Chicago and the cadence of a working life. However, I do think I started to adapt well - from teaching tennis after work to volunteering the extracurriculars really started to make me feel better about how I was living my life on a day to day basis. <strong>Also the time that I spent with my friends in Chicago and exploring the city is time that I wouldn’t give up for anything</strong>.</p>

<p>I also have decided that for 2019, I’m going to break my goals up more into quarters and when each quarter of the year ends, I’ll have a day over the weekend where I review the past quarter and can kind of analyze my status. That way I’ll have a better grip over how I’m doing and making sure that I’m still growing and learning at a good pace.</p>

<p>With this post, I’ve pretty much finalized by goals for 2019. I think I’m going to continue the tradition and post a 2019 year in review as well. So count on a similar post next December. Hopefully with a little bit more statistics.</p>
