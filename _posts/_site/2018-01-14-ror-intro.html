<p>I took a class on ruby on rails through Coursera. Here are my findings and comments about the class.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>First of all, the class itself is pretty interesting, but it’s really the thought of being well versed in web design and fast, but efficient, front-end prototyping… which partially screams ROR.</p>

<p>Ruby on rails was designed ideally for programmers so that they could build quick web templates easily. One of my goals for 2018 is to extend my knowledge of that domain, so this was the first step for that.</p>

<p>Here’s the coursera <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro/home">class</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/johnlarkin1/ror-intro">Here are all my solutions</a> to the assignments. NOTE! You should just use these as a reference to check.</p>

<p>Here our my <a href="/pdfs/RubyOnRailsIntroduction.pdf">notes</a>.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>There’s really not that much else for me to say. I’m pushing this out with relative brevity because I’m trying to push more stuff out to my blog in general. But! The coursera class was taught well and I’m happy I took it even to just start to get familiar with another language. And yeah :) I hope to take more classes soon in the future (if i can find the time).</p>
