Want to be quicker when using vim?  

Are you an avid Emacs user? Then this page is *not* going to be for you! 

I use Vim and much of the posts that I've written for this website, as well as much of the backend architecture I wrote in vim. For larger projects, I prefer using [atom](https://atom.io/) or [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/). However, for quicker projects, where I want a lightweight editor to access files and navigate a director quickly, I think vim is a perfect tool. Plus it's going to be hard to find a computer that doens't have vim installed. 

As I was coming up with this website and some of the blog posts, I found myself dying to know more shortcuts. I knew the basics, but I thought it might be great to have a post where I could just store / share some of the tricks that I've learned in a convenient place. Essentially, most of the information can be found [here](http://www.keyxl.com/aaa8263/290/VIM-keyboard-shortcuts.htm). However, I thought even that was overkill.
