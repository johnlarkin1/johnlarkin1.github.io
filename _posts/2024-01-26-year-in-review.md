# Introduction

Per my typical custom, this post is meant to cover my 2023 year. It's meant to be a moment of self reflection, in an ever increasingly busy world. 


# Thoughts on 2023
This blog post will be brief. 

I didn't do a great job of keeping track of my goals. I fell off around mid February in terms of daily journaling. And I think that's ok. I'm working on a couple of home built tools to do some of this automatically and aid me in being more self-reflective and having more insight into my mood, my thoughts, and how I can be a better person in general. 

So this will be relatively qualitative. 

## Looking Back

[Read the 2022 Year in Review here][2022-year-in-review].

> Re specifically for NY goals... Perhaps it's in my nature to oscillate, or perhaps it's the New York City air and vibe, but I'm going to go back to trying an Excel / Google sheets driven approach to keeping track of my New Years Resolutions. Once again, I'm divvying up my resolutions between **daily**, **weekly**, **monthly**, and **yearly**.

So while I'm still proud of the template I put together, I think actual execution was lacking. 

I'd mainly contribute that to the fact that it's a slightly high barrier to entry, either opening up the Notes App and remembering to journal, and then also opening up Google Sheets and filling in the daily / weekly / etc goal. 

I still stand by that New Years Resolution breakdown but I think the execution and _ease_ of execution could be improved. 

So I'm working on that as part of 2024.

## Major Life Updates

I'm currently on a flight to Chicago. One of my best friends from Chicago just got engaged and we're going to celebrate his engagement. 

I'm going to keep this brief given while 2023 was filled with growth, vacations, learnings and more, I think I'm going to keep them a bit more private for the moment. 

However, New York and my living situation has been a true blessing. I live with three incredible roommmates - Tommy, Nick, and Eliz. My best friends from college are in New York. My best friends from home come and visit and I see them more than I did in San Francisco. The city is vibrant, and alive, and it's what I'm looking for at the moment. My beautiful girlfriend is here and our easy proximity is an absolute delight. 

I'm lucky to have my life, my family, my friends, my living situation, and my job. And that order felt natural and I believe is how I've started to prioritize my life. I'm surrounded by people that push me to grow and be hungry. In my opinion, New York can take that too far, but the ethos of the city is something that I find intoxicating and that I'm happy with at the moment. 

## Going Forward

2024 has started off with an excellent start. I'm doing well with half-ironman training, Italian learning, relationship priorities, and work. I'm excited to blog monthly (and actually stick to it this year!). I've got quite a couple of things in the works for this year.
