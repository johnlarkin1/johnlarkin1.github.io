summary: Basically a stream of consciousness while sitting on the plane

# Content

I'm sitting on flight to San Diego currently. 

I just watched the third episode of **The Last of Us**. So nothing like just straight sobbing on the plane for an hour. 

For some reason, I feel like the plane is a safe space. Despite being packed in with people, I feel like there are slightly less rules and regulation. Does shame really exist on an airplane? You have business men sitting with crying babies and full grown adults popping their shoes off. People sobbing at dramas or laughing at comedies side by side. 

I guess my point is that, the third episode was good, and I'm not totally sure what to make of it. 

I suppose part of the reason it hit so hard is because I'm single right now. And I think seeing that juxtaposition that's displayed in the third episode strikes hard. Because of multiple reasons, but namely because I feel like I've had that level of emotion and connection (i mean not years of fortitude in the middle of a global pandemic) at least a couple times in my life. And I think moving to New York has been hard. Easier than SF, but just hard in different ways. 

The city is flushed with friends and fun. Endless sources of entertainment and excitement. New people and new adventures every night. 

My liver will probably give out, but hopefully it does before my memory because that would be a true dagger (and perhaps my subconscious is bringing this up given the episode). 

All that being said, I just have a lot to think about, and I think the pace of New York can be intoxicating (quite literally) but can also sometimes stifle levels of higher thinking. 

Like to enumerate some insecurities:

* Am I the person that I want to be?
* Have I changed since graduating college in a way that I'm proud of?
* Do I prioritize my relationships enough? Or even too much? 
* Do I take too much? Am I selfish? Or do I not put myself forward enough? 
* Am I good son? Can I do more to help my family dynamics / relationships with my sister and parents? 
* Do I focus on career and money too much? Is it an escape mechanism from me limiting more self exploration? 

All of these things I think are multifaceted but worth pondering. I think often with the constant stream of notifications and tech that can be hard to think about. And I do a shitty job of it in NYC. 

And there are always excuses to make. Oh late night out with friends, or - i mean really - to keep with the stream of consciousness - that's the one that sticks out the cleanest. And I wouldn't trade those moments for anything. But I just think I can be a bit more thoughtful and perhaps monitor some of that a bit more in real time. 

In all honesty, this is more thought out and less Jane-Austen-esque than I really wanted it to be. 

I should have probably blocked the delete button, or enforced some type of rule like that. 

Anyway, I'm not sure the point of this article, besides really just to stream some thoughts and maybe hold myself accountable in some way. Some roundabout way I should have said.

For one example, I was watching TV on the couch with my roommate on Saturday, and I bemoaned like "oh I haven't done anything today, I'm such a piece of shit."

And I still feel like that. Like that I need to be constantly producing. It's most likely a smooth concoction of factors from my over-achieving family, the American culture, and well yeah those are probably two of the big ones. The third one being it's just so deeply baked into me. Nature vs nurture I suppose. 

But my incredible roommate just said, "dude it's fine. cut yourself some slack" and just shrugged it off. And Henry and Rhian were like that too. 

So who knows. I read that book `How to Do Nothing - Resisting the Attention Economy` two years ago, and you know what? I hated it. I thought the professor was a bit arrogant and perhaps too grandiose in some of her conjectures. But! I do think the principals and thought behind it was solid. And had merit enough to think about and read. 

Maybe I just need to watch birds. That was one of the main things the author talked about.

Maybe that's the message of this post. Just to watch birds and hopefully think about your relationships and family a bit more. Maybe call your parents. 

I'll leave on this note. Given the stream of consciousness - somewhat stream, maybe more like a trickle - and the reference to bird watching not too long ago. 

I only really knew one of my two grandmothers unfortunately, and the very last thing she said to me when she was in the hospital was:

> Remember to watch the birds

And so with that, I encourage you to watch them as well.
