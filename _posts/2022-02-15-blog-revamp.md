You get it? Like the phoenix rising from the ashes but also a callback to Swarthmore's Phineas the Phoenix.

# Introduction

This won't be a long one because most of the work was just moving things around, changing some slight `scss`, and really picking out a font, but I'm counting this as my blog post for the month of February. Also I'm technically finishing this up on the 16th - so happy birthday to my incredible big sister Sydney ~~Larkin~~ Proffer.

I'm now using a theme called `Sleek` for the blog. I conferred / chose it with the help of my allstar roommates Henry and Rhian (and yeah they're also dating so I'm a perpetual third wheel).
