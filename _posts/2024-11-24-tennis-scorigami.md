# Motivation

Two of my absolute best friends - [Henry Head][hen] and [Sebastian Hoar][seb] - had the idea to apply the [NFL scorigami][nfl-scorigami] notion to tennis.

The problem is a little different (maybe even more interesting) because it's not just two scores, but really multiple different scores given tennis has sets. So this introduces a slightly higher level of almost dimensionality.

Anyway, before we dive into all that, I would highly recommend just checking out the website! It should be fully live and deployed at [https://tennis-scorigami.com/][https://tennis-scorigami.com/].

This post is going to be long, and we're going to break down different parts to different leads.
