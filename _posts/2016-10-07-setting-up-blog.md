How did are you seeing this?

There's a lot of different ways that you can go around building something. I actually struggled to generate this page... and this blog. It was small things, but the progress was relatively slow. I figured that it might be best if I create a page (largely for myself)) where I can store what I learned and also give attributions. 

First of all, a lot of what I learned in how to model and create the design of the blog was based off of one of my Swarthmore professor's blogs. Specifically, [Matt Zucker's blog](https://mzucker.github.io/) was *really* helpful. 

Second of all (which in hindsite, probably should have been my first resource), the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) homepage was helpful.

Third, I became desperate and needed some help. 
Finally, just a lot of testing around with the site.
