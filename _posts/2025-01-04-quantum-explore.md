<div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-disclaimer">
<p>First of all, I want to clarify that I am by no means an expert in anything quantum. I have no PhD. The farthest I ever got was taking Physical Chemistry (PChem) I and II in college. I have not worked at Google, or a leading quantum company. I haven't ever run a program on a quantum board.</p>

<p>That being said, it's always been something I've loved and been captivated by. PChem was one of my favorite classes in college. I still distinctively remember sitting in the second floor of Science Center with <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/profile/kathleen-howard">Kathleen Howard</a>. A couple of my brilliant classmates were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditi-kulkarni-72a267131">Aditi Kulkarni</a> (my lab partner for most of it), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bmcorthores/p/Cyw7wYKsUwH/">Brian Gibbs</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-kirsh-338754b3">Jacob Kirsh</a>. All brilliant and now either all getting PhDs, MDs, or some other impressive feat. Kirsh is even getting his PhD in biophysical chemistry at Caltech now. Fun quantum related note, one of my friends parents is also CEO of a major (public) quantum computing company. </p>

<p>All of that is really more from a true underling quantum physics perspective, but as for quantum computing, I am even farther from an expert. The one claim to fame is in my Algorithms class with <a href="https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~brody/">Josh Brody</a> is him calling out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor's Algorithm</a>, which is a quantum approach for factoring prime numbers. This obviously has huge repercussions for encryption and cyber security.</p>

<p>The only other disclaimer is that I have numerous long positions in a couple of publicly traded quantum computing companies. </p>

<p>Regardless, this will hopefully be a review of some fun things I learned back in PChem, as well as looking at it a little bit more from a true quantum computing angle.</p>

# Motivation

In this post, we're going to:

<!-- 1. Review some quantum computing fundamentals
2. Look at Google's Willow post
3. Look at some backlash that was trending from Google's post
4. Explore IONQ's trapped ion approach
5. Explore IBM's `qiskit` Python library for designing and building circuits
6. See if we can run some semblance of an experiment (either mirroring Google's random circuit sampling benchmark or even Shor's algorithm as a rough heuristic) -->

1. Review some quantum physics fundamentals
2. See how those apply to the quantum computing landscape
3. Look at some very basic visualizations and ideas
4. Explore some public companies and latest research that I'm interested in (just bullish in the space)
5. Talk about what might be next

# Quantum Physics Fundamentals

## History

I'm going to start with some history because it'll set the scene. Obviously, this could be a whole semester long course at a collegiate level, so this is going to be the heavily Sparknotes version.

### Tangent on _When We Cease to Understand the World_

Also the history is a bit topical given I've been reading [**_When We Cease to Understand the World_**][when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world] by Benjamin Labatut. It's a beautifully written book and the section of the book I'm currently on discusses at length [Werner Heisenberg][heisenberg] and [Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger][schrodinger]. I'd highly recommend it.

That being said, the book is creative non-fiction, which means that a lot of the stories are exaggerated or have fiction sprinkled in to entice and entertain the readers. That's all well and good,, but makes for a frustrating reading experience sometimes given I'm googling if things really happened.

For example, the quantum physics portion starts by telling the story of how [Heiseinberg interrupted SchrÃ¶dinger's lecture][schrod-interrupts]. As far as I can tell, that just [did not happen][when-we-cease-fiction]. I could not find any trace of it online. [I even asked Perplexity][perplexity-search].

Regardless, let's move on.

## Timeline

This Wikipedia article, [Timeline of Quantum Mechanics][quantum-mech-timeline], is going to do a far far better job then I ever will. I have summarized and pulled out some key points here:

# Miscellaneous

If curious, I sadly don't have my PChem notebook or binder given they burned down with my Dad's house (or I might have given it to some of the younger tennis guys ðŸ˜¬), but I did manage to find part of the first homework that I turned in for one of my additional problems for PChem.
