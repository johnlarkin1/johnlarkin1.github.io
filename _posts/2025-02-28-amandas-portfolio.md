Alright, well.... this is going to be a **VERY** short one, but my February project for 2025 was helping my girlfriend get her website off the ground.

So that's what I'm here to promote. I own the domain, but it's a NextJS, React, Typescript project that's fun and home built.

Feel free to check it out here: [Amanda's Portfolio](https://www.amandawestort.com) or here: [amandawestort.com](https://www.amandawestort.com).

You can also explore the site directly below:

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 75%;">
  <iframe src="https://www.amandawestort.com" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br/>

This was a fun project to work on together and I'm hoping there are more in the future.
