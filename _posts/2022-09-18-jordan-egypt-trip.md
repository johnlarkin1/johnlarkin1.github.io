Eh I didn't have a lot of time this month to work on technical projects, but I still wanted to post on my blog once a month.

Introduction
============
Well, I'm writing this on the plane ride back from one of the most incredible trips I'll probably ever take in my life. My sister, brother-in-law, Dad, and I did two weeks split between Jordan and Egypt. We saw the ancient city of Petra, rode camels through the desert of Wadi Rum, saw the Great Pyramids of Giza, floated on the Nile, and toured the markets of Cairo.
